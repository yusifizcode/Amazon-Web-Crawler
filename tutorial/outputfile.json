Only issue I had was I did not know this was formatted in X-FAT32. I bought this thumb drive to put the movies I have on my PC on it so that I could watch them in my living room on my smart tv... after spending a couple hours transferring files to the drive, I plug it into my smart tv and get an error telling me that the drive was not supported. I tried it on my Sony Blu-ray that has a usb slot for external media and it doesn\u2019t recognize the drive either. I tell my husband about it and he says I need to format the thumb drive with a regular FAT32 file system. Well, I did as I was instructed, reloaded the movies after formatting with FAT32 and bingo! Both my smart tv and my Blu-ray can now read the files on the drive! So, if anyone has problems with your devices reading or even recognizing the drive after loading files in the X-FAT32 format, reformat the drive with FAT32 and then reload your files. You should be good to go! SANDISK, YOU REALLY SHOULD LABLE THE PACKAGING WITH THE TYPE OF FORMATING ON THE DRIVE!

I wanted to have more storage and I wanted to spend less than a micro SD card. I didn't need USB 3.0 since the Raspberry Pi only has USB 2.0, so I picked this bad boy up in the 128 GB flavor.APPEARANCEThe USB stick itself is two tone black. There's a matted black and a piano glossy black. The slider which reveals the USB female connector is red. The actual build quality of the USB stick is very cheap. The plastic feels very thin, which makes the entire stick feels flimsy. Be gentle with handling the device. Especially with the female connector protruding. If you're looking for a rugged device this may not be what you're looking for.FUNCTIONALITYLots of people have already posted pictures of read write speeds, so I won't post that. What I will say is that I get between 4 - 11 MBps in real world usage transferring files from my pc and this stick. When going from the stick to my pc I get between 24 - 27 MBps. Within the indentation of the slider is where you will find the transfer light. Regrettably, the light is very faint. SanDisk probably did this to conserve on power consumption. Also, the location of the light is too close to the slider. At times, it blends with the slider making it even harder to see. I would have liked to see the light somewhere more prominent such as the very back of the stick on the matted section. Another issue I have is that sometimes you do not get a good connection causing the pc to not see the stick. The light still comes on but the pc does not register the device. To fix this I re-plug it in.PROS\u25a0 Good price / storage ratio;\u25a0 No random disconnects (yet); and\u25a0 Okay transfer speeds.CONS\u25a0 Larger than I hoped for;\u25a0 Dim transfer light;\u25a0 Poor location for transfer light;\u25a0 USB connection is sometimes finicky (Once it's connected the stick is fine no random disconnects); and\u25a0 Cheap build quality.I know that there are a lot of cons to this stick, but it's not a bad stick. The price more than compensates for the issues and I haven't run into any fatal errors with the stick as of now. If that changes I will be sure to update my review.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2017", "starRating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "One person found this helpful", "nextPage": "/SanDisk-Cruzer-Glide-Drive-SDCZ60-032G-B35/product-reviews/B007YX9O9E?pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"}
